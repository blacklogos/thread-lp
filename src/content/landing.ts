  faq: [
    {
      question: "Is Thread to HTML really free?",
      answer: "Yes, completely free! No hidden fees, premium tiers, or data collection. We believe in open-source tools for the community."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you store the threads I convert?",
      answer: "No. All conversion happens locally in your browser. We never store, track, or access your data."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the HTML on my website?",
      answer: "Absolutely. The exported HTML can be used anywhere - blogs, portfolios, Notion, Medium, or any website."
    },
    {
      question: "What if Twitter/X removes the thread?",
      answer: "Since the HTML is converted locally and stored on your device, you keep the full content even if the original thread is deleted."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it work with replies and threads?",
      answer: "Yes, it works with single tweets, entire threads, and reply chains. Just select the content you want to convert."
    },
    {
      question: "Will this break my website?",
      answer: "No. The generated HTML is clean, self-contained, and compatible with all modern browsers and CMS platforms."
